Art Gallery - Virtual Reality Project

Overview

The Art Gallery is a Virtual Reality (VR) experience developed using Unity3D and the XR Interaction Toolkit. This project allows users to explore a curated digital gallery, interact with various artworks, and listen to voiceovers describing each piece. The gallery includes smooth locomotion and teleportation for seamless navigation.

Features

VR Locomotion: Users can move using both teleportation and smooth locomotion.

Interactive Artworks: Approach an artwork to trigger a floating UI panel displaying its title, artist, and description.

Voiceover Integration: Each artwork has a physical button that, when pressed, plays a voiceover description.

Object Interaction: Users can grab small objects in the gallery.

Planned Feature: A remote control system to toggle lighting above each artwork.
